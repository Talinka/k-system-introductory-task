# Simple user list

Web application, which shows list of users and allows to change user status.
For creating the application was used create-react-app.
For state managing it uses redux-toolkit.
It's my first experience with TypeScript and Material-UI.

## Building The Code

To build the code, follow these steps.

1. Ensure that [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) is installed.

2. From the project folder, execute one of the following commands:

  ```shell
  npm install
  ```

3. To build the code, you can run:

  ```shell
  npm run build
  ```

4. You will find the compiled code in the `dist` folder
